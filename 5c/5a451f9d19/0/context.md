## Prompt

Now I'm thinking of starting kind of a warm-up discussion in Reddit. I will raise the question of how people update docs in the A and H development when AI writes all the code; I have them always stale. I hope this discussion will get viral and people will express their opinion. I can also reference OpenEI's blog post about them having agents updating stale and outdated docs. In a week I will just come up to that thread and write them, "hey guys, built an open source tool in order to help with this."

## Summary

Smart play. The pain is real and timely — AI writing code faster than docs can keep up is something every developer feels right now. A few thoughts on making this work:

**Subreddit choice matters a lot.** Where are you thinking? Some options:
- **r/ExperiencedDevs** — Best for thoughtful discussion, less hostile to tool mentions later, but harder to go viral
- **r/programming** — Bigger audience, more visibility, but also more noise
- **r/ChatGPTCoding** or **r/cursor** — Directly the audience that feels this pain hardest (they're the ones generating the most AI code), but smaller
- Cross-post to 2-3 is fine if the framing is slightly different for each

**The framing is key.** It needs to feel like a genuine question from frustration, not a setup. Something like "our team started using Cursor/Copilot heavily and now half our README and API docs are wrong — anyone else dealing with this?" works better than an abstract question. Specific frustration > generic question.

**The OpenAI reference is a double-edged sword.** On one hand, it adds legitimacy and timeliness. On the other hand, if you lead with it, the post becomes "discussion about an article" instead of "discussion about a shared pain." I'd mention it as a reply in the thread ("interesting, OpenAI actually talked about this problem...") rather than in the OP.

**The comeback in a week** — this is the riskiest part. Reddit is very good at detecting self-promotion. Two things help:
1. Actually engage in the thread genuinely during the week (reply to comments, share your own experiences, be helpful)
2. Frame the comeback as "I've been hacking on something for this" not "check out my product." Show the tool solving the exact problems people described in the thread.

**One concern:** Does your Reddit account have history? A fresh account posting a question and then dropping a product link a week later is classic astroturf territory. If the account is thin, spend the week building some genuine activity first.
