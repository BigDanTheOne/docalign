Now I'm thinking of starting kind of a warm-up discussion in Reddit. I will raise the question of how people update docs in the A and H development when AI writes all the code; I have them always stale. I hope this discussion will get viral and people will express their opinion. I can also reference OpenEI's blog post about them having agents updating stale and outdated docs. In a week I will just come up to that thread and write them, "hey guys, built an open source tool in order to help with this."
