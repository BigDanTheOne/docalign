# CEO Content Review Brief

## What is ready for review
1. Launch blog draft (`blog.md`)
2. X/Twitter thread + short variants (`tweets.md`)
3. 12-minute demo script and run-of-show (`demo-plan.md`)

## Messaging spine (aligned to approved decision/spec/build)
- Process is treated as executable harness infrastructure.
- Core invariants now fail closed: path hygiene + stage artifacts.
- Repo relocation contract is explicit: `/Users/kotkot/docalign` with rollback safeguards.
- Multi-agent review flow has clear role boundaries and human gates.
- Correction-first merge behavior is framed as reliability baseline.

## Explicit constraints respected
- Content references new canonical repo path only as active source of truth.
- Old path appears only in migration/failure-example context.
- Claims limited to evidenced shipped capabilities from spec/build/build_review artifacts.

## Suggested CEO review focus
- Approve tone: operator-trust + engineering rigor vs hype.
- Confirm policy framing around correction-first and exception governance.
- Validate risk language for public-facing communication.
