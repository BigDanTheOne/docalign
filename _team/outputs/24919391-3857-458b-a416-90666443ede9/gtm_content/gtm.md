# GTM Content Stage Output

VERDICT: completed

DELIVERABLES:
- `blog.md` — launch narrative and CTA
- `tweets.md` — thread + short social variants
- `demo-plan.md` — 12-minute demo runbook
- `content-review-brief.md` — CEO review framing and constraints checklist

ALIGNMENT NOTES:
- Uses approved decision framing: fail-closed invariants, correction-first posture, auditable exceptions, human gates.
- Uses shipped build evidence: resolver, path checks, stage-artifact checks, migration/rollback scripts, runbook governance.
- Reflects relocation contract and compatibility-sunset constraints.

RISKS TO WATCH IN REVIEW:
- Avoid implying universal guarantees; keep claims tied to implemented harness scope.
- Ensure public copy does not over-emphasize internal path specifics beyond trust/operational relevance.

CONFIDENCE: high
