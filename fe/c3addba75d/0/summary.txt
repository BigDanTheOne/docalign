Here's the complete answer:

**There are two completely separate tag systems, and only one is automated:**

**`docalign:claim` tags — automatically stamped by DocAlign**
`src/tags/writer.ts` exists and can automatically write inline tags like `<!-- docalign:claim id="..." type="..." status="verified" -->` into markdown after the source line of a verified/drifted claim. However — this module is **not yet wired into any CLI command**. It's built but dormant; `writeTagsToFile` is exported from `src/tags/index.ts` but nothing calls it.

**`docalign:skip` / `docalign:check` / `docalign:semantic` tags — manually authored test infrastructure**
These only appear in `test/fixtures/corpora/synthetic-node/tagged/` — they were written by hand when building the corpus to tell the corpus test runner what to verify, what to skip, and what the expected semantic claims are. They have **no automatic generation path** in the real pipeline. Regular users would have to write them by hand, which is exactly what you just called out as wrong.

**So the answer to your question:** There is currently no Claude Code hook, no CLI command, and no automation that stamps `docalign:skip` tags into documentation. The `docalign:skip` tag system was designed as a user escape hatch, but if users have to manually annotate their docs to suppress false positives, that's a broken design. 

DocAlign needs to be smart enough to not produce those false positives in the first place — which means fixing the extractors to recognize illustrative/instructional content, not teaching users to paper over bad extraction with skip tags.
