Deterministic - identical output both times. The verbose flag doesn't seem to show the 23 verified claims, which would be useful for a full audit. But the result is clear: same 2 false positives, nothing else flagged.

Want me to also run `docalign scan` on the full repo to see the broader picture, or would you rather dig into the extractor logic to understand why it's misclassifying examples and instructions as claims?
