Here's what I changed:

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — 4 fixes:

1. **Added Postgres service** (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`) with health checks — matches your `docker-compose.yml` exactly
2. **Added Redis service** (`redis:7-alpine`) with health checks — same
3. **Added `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` env vars** — so all tests that do `process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://...'` connect to the CI services
4. **Added `npm run migrate:up` step** before tests — creates the tables tests need
5. **Removed the `stage-artifacts` gate** — it was hardcoded to a specific pipeline run ID (`24919391-...`), which is meaningless in CI. This check is for validating pipeline-produced artifacts during autonomous builds, not for general CI.

**`vitest.config.ts`** — 1 fix:

6. **Added `.openclaw/**` to vitest excludes** — the `pipeline-gate-format.test.js` file lives at `.openclaw/skills/pipeline/scripts/` and requires local pipeline infrastructure (SQLite DB, home directory paths, git worktrees). It's a pipeline infrastructure test, not a product test.
