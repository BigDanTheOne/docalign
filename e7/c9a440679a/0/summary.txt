All done. Here's the summary:

**Merge conflicts resolved and PR updated:**

- All 8 conflict regions in `.openclaw/skills/pipeline/scripts/pipeline.js` were resolved by keeping HEAD (main) — the co-developer's enhanced version that includes:
  - `resolveMainRepo()` — multi-path resolution for worktree operations
  - `normalizeMultiline()` — fixes escaped newlines in markdown feedback
  - `parseEpochMs()` — safe ISO date parsing for race safety
  - Enhanced empty-followups handling (`timed_out_no_feedback` special case)
  - Codex item source tracking and `codex_issue_count` consistency validation

- One commit was dropped as "patch contents already upstream" — our branch's changes were already superseded by HEAD's enhanced version.

- Branch `feat/port-followup-triage-gate` rebased onto latest `main` and force-pushed. No features lost.
