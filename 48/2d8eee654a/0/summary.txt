Written to `test/qa/CORPUS-DESIGN.md`.

The document is self-contained — a future session can open it and execute from Section 11 (implementation checklist) in order without needing any of this conversation for context.

A few things worth noting about the structure:

**Section 6.3 (code file blueprints)** is the piece that prevents the most common implementation mistake — writing a code file that doesn't actually satisfy the claims it's supposed to support. It tells whoever writes `src/middleware/auth.ts` exactly what must be in it and why.

**Section 7.4 (mutation auto-generation algorithm)** is written precisely enough that the `corpus:gen-mutations` script can be implemented directly from it, including the ambiguity check.

**Section 9 (bootstrap workflow)** has a human review step (Steps 4 and 7) that can't be automated. A future session needs to know those exist and not skip them.

The one thing the document deliberately does not contain is the actual file contents of the corpus — those come in the next session, using Section 6.3 and 6.4 as the spec.
