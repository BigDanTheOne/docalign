**5 claims, 5 verified, 0 drifted, 0 false positives.** 100% accuracy.

The assertion pruning works: any pattern Claude guessed without actually verifying via Grep gets silently dropped because it fails our own check. Only assertions that match real code survive. The combination is:

1. **Prompt says "verify with Grep"** — Claude follows it ~90% of the time, producing good assertions
2. **Code prunes failures** — the ~10% that slip through get dropped deterministically

No loops, no second pass. Just one extraction + one filter.
