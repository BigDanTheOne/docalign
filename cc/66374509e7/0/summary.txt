Claude generated `summary` and `read_when` and they were written directly into the doc file's frontmatter. 

Here's what was implemented:

## Summary

### Step 0 — Documentation Mind Map (complete)

**New files:**
- `src/cli/doc-map.ts` — `DocMapEntry`/`DocMap` types, load/save, frontmatter parser (handles YAML lists), `buildDocFileSnippets`, `renderDocFileSnippets`, `writeFrontmatterFields`
- `src/cli/prompts/doc-map.ts` — Step 0 Claude prompt (no tools, one call for all files)
- `test/cli/doc-map.test.ts` — 22 unit tests

**Modified files:**
- `src/cli/prompts/semantic-extract.ts` — Accepts optional `DocMapEntry` param; injects document context block into Phase 1
- `src/layers/L1-claim-extractor/semantic-extractor.ts` — Threads `DocMapEntry` through `buildExtractionPrompt` and `extractSemanticClaims`
- `src/cli/real-pipeline.ts` — `buildDocMap()` method; `extractSemantic()` auto-runs Step 0 if no doc-map exists; passes per-file entry to extraction

**How it works:**
1. First `extract` run → Step 0 fires: one Claude call (no tools) reads all doc file snippets (path + frontmatter + headings) and classifies each
2. Claude generates `summary`, `read_when`, `doc_type`, `skip_hint`, `extraction_notes` per file
3. `summary` + `read_when` are written back into the doc's frontmatter (for files that don't already have them)
4. Classification saved to `.docalign/doc-map.json`
5. Subsequent runs → doc-map loaded from cache; per-file context injected into Phase 1 of every extraction prompt

**`summary`/`read_when` frontmatter:** 12 docs already updated manually as bootstrap; the remaining 5 (guides without these fields) will be auto-generated by Step 0 on next `extract` run. Any new doc files will also be auto-stamped.
