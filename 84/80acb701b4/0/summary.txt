All 9 issues are now fixed. Here's a summary:

## All 9 Issues — Fixed

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | `review_loop_count` per-run bug | `complete-step` now computes `stage_rejection_count` from the steps table per-stage. Returns `escalation_recommended: true` at >= 3. Global counter kept for reporting only. |
| **2** | Missing competitive scan cron | Added daily cron job at 7am ET — spawns researcher to scan competitor changelogs/releases, proposes features to CEO if warranted. |
| **3** | Missing Mem0 auto-capture config | Added `mem0` plugin entry in `openclaw.json` with `autoRecall: false`, `autoCapture: true`. |
| **4** | Chief AGENTS.md missing "handoff" | Added `handoff` to the skills list in chief's AGENTS.md. |
| **5** | Section 8 GTM debate contradiction | Updated Section 8 to match Section 2: all 4 personas (PM, Tech Lead, Critic, GTM) participate in feature debates. Also fixed in orchestrator AGENTS.md. |
| **6** | store.sh `--content` flag vs positional | Updated design doc Section 7 skill interface to use `--content` flag (matching implementation). |
| **7** | Cron messages don't match design | Updated Morning Brief to mention "overnight scan results" and Afternoon Check to mention "competitive scan results". |
| **8** | 'paused' status never used | Implemented `pause` and `resume` commands in pipeline.js. Pause frees a concurrency slot; resume respects the limit. |
| **9** | Heartbeat interval not configured | Documented in design doc that OpenClaw auto-detects HEARTBEAT.md and triggers at platform default interval. No explicit config needed. |
