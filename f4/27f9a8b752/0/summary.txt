That worked really well. Here's what happened when you pushed back:

1. **Chief received your feedback** via my relay (fresh session, correct model — no 401)
2. **Chief spawned an Orchestrator** (`orchestrator-24919391-define-revision`) to rewrite the decision doc
3. **Orchestrator rewrote `decision.md`** — from ~5KB to 13KB, now fully self-contained
4. The doc now has 9 detailed decisions (D1–D9), each with:
   - **What it is** (explained from scratch, no blog knowledge needed)
   - **Current DocAlign behavior** (what's broken today)
   - **Concrete change proposed** (exact implementation steps)
   - **Rationale / Trade-offs / Expected impact**
5. It ends with **6 explicit CEO decision points** (approve/modify/reject) and a phased implementation plan

**One issue:** The pipeline DB lookup failed because Chief used the short ID `24919391` instead of the full UUID. It worked around it by directly editing the file, but the pipeline state wasn't formally updated. That's a minor robustness issue in the pipeline.js script (doesn't do prefix matching).

**Did you receive a Telegram notification** about the revised doc? I can see from the Chief transcript it read the pipeline YAML and spawned the Orchestrator, but I want to confirm the notification path worked.
