The Chief is alive and responded properly. Here's what it said:

> **Hello CEO — Chief is operational.**
>
> **1) Available skills:** pipeline, mem0, notify, handoff, content-copilot
>
> **2) Available sub-agents:** orchestrator, researcher
>
> **3) Pipeline status:**
> - **Active (1):** "Apply Harness Engineering patterns to DocAlign + relocate project" — stage: `pre_debate_research`
> - **Escalated (1):** "E2E Escalation Test" — stage: `review`, review_loop_count: 3

It correctly loaded all 7 workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, BOOTSTRAP.md), all 5 skills, and ran a real pipeline status check against the SQLite DB. The escalated run is the leftover from our E2E test — I can clean that up if you want.
