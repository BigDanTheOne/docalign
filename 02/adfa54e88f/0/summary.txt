It's running in the background. You can monitor the output file, or I'll check when it completes. The key change: instead of 19 sequential Claude subprocesses, we now run up to 5 at the same time — so theoretical wall-clock time drops from ~38 min → ~8 min for 19 docs.

The implementation is a simple inline semaphore (no new dependencies):
- `acquireSem()` / `releaseSem()` gate how many Claude subprocesses run at once
- `Promise.all` fans out all files simultaneously, but each one waits for the semaphore before calling `extractSemanticClaims`
- Shared counters (`totalExtracted`, etc.) are safe because JS is single-threaded
