All clean. Here's the summary of what was built:

## Summary

### Feature 3: Remediation-Aware Lint Errors
- **`docalign/scripts/lint-remediation.json`** — Maps all 24 ESLint rules to fix instructions + examples
- **`docalign/scripts/agent-lint.js`** — Zero-dependency wrapper that runs ESLint and enriches output with `FIX:` and `EXAMPLE:` lines
- **`docalign/CONVENTIONS.md`** — Project coding conventions reference for agents
- **`package.json`** — Added `lint:agent` script

### Feature 2: Agent-Legible Dev Environment
- **`~/.openclaw/skills/pipeline/scripts/agent-dev.sh`** — Boots isolated dev env (creates per-run Postgres DB, generates `.env.agent`, runs migrations, starts app on random port, writes `.agent-dev.json`)
- **`~/.openclaw/skills/pipeline/scripts/agent-dev-cleanup.sh`** — Tears down (kills process, drops DB, removes config files)
- **`pipeline.js` `removeWorktree()`** — Hooked to call cleanup before worktree removal
- **`.gitignore`** — Added `.agent-dev.json` and `.env.agent`
- **`package.json`** — Added `dev:agent` and `dev:agent:cleanup` scripts

### Feature 1: EXEC_PLAN.md (Execution Plans)
- **`pipeline.js` `assembleExecPlan()`** — ~120-line function that reads SQLite run data + artifact files, assembles a self-contained markdown exec plan (adapts template by pipeline type)
- **`pipeline.js` `cmdAdvance()`** — Auto-calls `assembleExecPlan()` alongside `createWorktree()` when advancing to build
- **Orchestrator `AGENTS.md`** — Build workflow rewritten: coding agent reads EXEC_PLAN.md directly instead of receiving context through prompt. Handoff section updated to note EXEC_PLAN.md replaces manual handoff generation.

### Tested
- `npm run lint:agent` produces enriched output with FIX/EXAMPLE lines
- `pipeline.js advance --stage build` creates worktree + writes EXEC_PLAN.md (verified with both task and feature pipeline runs with real artifacts)
- `pipeline.js complete-run` cleans up worktree + dev env
- Feature exec plan correctly includes: decision doc, specification, review conditions, stage history, validation instructions, integration testing section
