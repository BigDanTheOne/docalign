Fixed. Here's what was wrong and what changed:

**Problem:** `docalign init` generated hooks in the old Claude Code format:
```json
{ "matcher": "Bash", "pattern": "git commit", "command": "echo ..." }
```

**Fix:** Updated to the new hooks format that Claude Code expects:
```json
{ "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "..." }] }
```

**Changes:**
- `src/cli/commands/init.ts` — Updated the `HookEntry` interface and hook generation to use `{ matcher, hooks: [{ type, command }] }` instead of `{ matcher, pattern, command }`. Since the new format doesn't support a `pattern` field for input filtering, the git-commit check is done inside the hook command itself via `grep`.
- `test/cli/commands/init.test.ts` — Updated all 4 hook-related tests to assert the new structure.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — Fixed the existing broken file in this repo.

All 7 tests pass and the build succeeds. You can re-run `npx docalign init` (or just restart Claude Code) and the error should be gone.
