Clean. The change is:

**Before**: Chief's AGENTS.md said "you can spawn orchestrator" and "advance the pipeline before spawning" — which the Chief interpreted as optional, and it just did everything itself.

**After**: Explicit rule — "You are the CEO's interface, NOT a pipeline executor." With a clear whitelist of the only `pipeline.js` commands the Chief may call (`create`, `status`/`list`, `complete-run`). Everything else is the orchestrator's job.

That's problem #1 addressed. The Chief will now always delegate to the orchestrator.

The remaining problems you flagged earlier still exist:
- **Problem #2**: Even if the orchestrator is spawned, its turn could still end before it calls Claude Code CLI for the build stage (same stuck-at-build issue, just one level deeper)
- **Problem #3**: No watchdog to detect stuck pipelines

Want to tackle #2 next — making sure the orchestrator actually completes the build in its turn?
